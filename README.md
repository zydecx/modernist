# Modernist Theme

Original work is done by [orderedlist](http://github.com/orderedlist). Based on that, `index_zydecx.html` and `styles_zydecx.css` are added to support two-column layout for better experience in blogs.

[Demo the original Theme(One-Column)](http://zydecx.github.io/modernist/index.html)

[Demo the new Theme(Two-Columns)](http://zydecx.github.io/modernist/index_zydecx.html)

This is the raw HTML and styles that are used for the *modernist* theme on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

# SCSS

Orignal project uses SCSS for it's CSS. As time limited, new theme(two-column) doesn't do the same way. But it's still recommended to do as before. If you want to contribute, please make your changes to the .scss files in the /sass directory. If you're unfamiliar with SCSS, here's [an excellent article to get you started](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getting-started-with-sass/). I recommend using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com)

Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub Pages by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).
